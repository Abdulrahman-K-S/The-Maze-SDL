# Introduction
While I was viewing my ideas for this project I came across The Maze project and at first I was intrigued to know what it talks about, and after further reasearch on it I was completely invested in the idea of implementing a raycaster even though it was a topic vastly beyond my knowledge.

This repository documents my attempts on tackling such a challenge and using all the resources available to finish it on time.
